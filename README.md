# Github search tool

## Created by Davit Lursmanashvili

This is a search tool that allows the user to search for GitHub users, as well as repos belonging to selected users. It uses dynamic routing, allows the user to sort the search results, and is very simple to use. 

You can see it in action [HERE](https://github-seach-project.netlify.app/).
